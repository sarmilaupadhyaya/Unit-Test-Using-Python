After writing codes and being frustrated over them over the long time, I somehow managed to start this repo to dump few things I have been learning about UnitTesting. This repo contains basics of unittesting and doctest. For more advance testing architecture, I will be using pytest, simultaneously for module, api testing. 

This is for reference purpose only. I am finding pushing my learning notes in git quite useful and efficient.
